;You see, we believe strongly that regular internet users like you should have a lot more control of your own data — what is collected, who collects it, and how it is shared, bought, or sold. We think privacy should always be top of mind, and that companies and organizations should adopt lean data practices instead of vacuuming up every byte of information about you that they possibly can.
